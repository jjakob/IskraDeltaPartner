I acquired the computer in approximately 2009 from my primary school when I was in last grade before going to high school. They wanted to throw it out so I asked if I could have it. It was missing the keyboard however and didn'd boot so I didn't do much with it other than take it apart, photograph its insides and publish them on a forum. It got put into storage as I was off to high school and didn't have time to mess with this old stuff!
